# Movie-Rating-Prediction-System

## Introduction

Movies play a significant role in entertainment and global commerce. With the growing number of movies, predicting what an individual might like has become a fascinating topic. Various platforms like IMDb, TMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic provide a wealth of data on movie ratings and reviews. Analyzing this data can offer insights into predicting movie ratings and understanding factors that influence these ratings. This project aims to build a movie rating prediction system using various machine learning algorithms.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project are:
- To predict movie ratings based on available data.
- To compare the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in predicting movie ratings.
- To identify the key factors that influence movie ratings, aiding producers in film promotion.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Millions of Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies).

### Dataset Description

The dataset consists of metadata for over 700,000 movies listed in the IMDb database. It includes various attributes such as:
1. **Id**: IMDB id assigned
2. **Title**: Title of movies
3. **Genres**: '-' separated categories that the movie belongs to
4. **Original Language**: Language the movie is made in
5. **Overview**: A short description of the movies
6. **Popularity**: IMDB metric of the popularity ratio
7. **Production Companies**: '-' separated production company names
8. **Release Date**: Movie release date (yyyy-mm-dd)
9. **Budget**: Entire gross budget of the movie
10. **Revenue**: Total revenue generated by the movie
11. **Runtime**: Total duration of the movie runtime
12. **Status**: Status of the movie (Released, in production, Not released, rumored, etc.)
13. **Tagline**: Tagline of the movie
14. **Vote Average**: Average votes given by IMDb users
15. **Vote Count**: Count of total users who gave votes
16. **Credits**: '-' Separated cast of the movie
17. **Keywords**: '-' separated keywords describing the movie
18. **Poster Path**: Poster image path of movies
19. **Backdrop Path**: Background images path of the movies
20. **Recommendations**: '-' separated recommended movie ids

## Methodology

### a. Collecting the Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle: [Millions of Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies).

### b. Importing the Dataset
The dataset is imported using the `read.csv()` function in Python. The `head()` function is used to display the content of the dataset.

### c. Data Cleaning
- Renamed the column `vote_average` to `imdb_ratings`.
- Checked and handled null values in the dataset.
- Created a new dataframe for movies with more than 20 vote counts.
- Dropped irrelevant categorical columns.
- Replaced zeros with the mean or median of the column where appropriate.

### d. Data Visualization
Utilized libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data:
- Displayed counts of IMDb ratings.
- Generated a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables.

### e. Feature Scaling
Standardized the dataset using the `StandardScaler()` function from Scikit-learn to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

### f. Algorithms and Their Accuracy
The following algorithms were used:
- **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Linear Regression**

The models were evaluated based on accuracy, with Random Forest and KNN showing the highest accuracy.

### g. Results and Model Comparison
A classification report was generated to evaluate the models, focusing on precision, recall, and F1 score. The Random Forest model and KNN model provided the highest accuracy with 86%.

## Conclusion
Feature scaling and data visualization significantly improved model accuracy. Random Forest and KNN algorithms showed the best performance. This study provides a promising direction for predicting movie ratings and understanding the factors that influence them.
